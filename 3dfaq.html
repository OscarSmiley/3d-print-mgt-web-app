      <a name="how-submit"></a><br><b>How to submit a 3D print</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Log into your <a href="customer-dashboard.php">dashboard</a> and click on submit new print job. Upload a 3D file and fill out the fields. Click submit. If you want to know what infill, layer height, scale, and whether to use supports or not please read what those specifications mean below. If you have specific questions regarding your print; email us at dscommons@uvic.ca or submit a job with what you think you want and leave a note in the options. We will help out and answer any questions you may have.
    </p>


    <p>
      <a name="specs"></a><br><b>Infill</b>
    </p>
        <p>
          The infill is the percentage of the inside of the print that is filled with material. A higher infill makes the object sturdy and able to bear more weight, but can significantly increase the cost. Most decorative items can have 5-10% infill. Having no infill is not advised, unless the object was specifically designed to be printed with zero infill.
        </p>
        <img src="img/infill.jpg" alt="10, 5, and 20 percent infill">
        <p>
          <b>Scale</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The scale is the size of the print by comparison to the size it was designed to be. Many models are printed at 100% scale, but it is also common to change the size. Keep in mind: when decreasing model size, you will also be decreasing wall thickness and the size of detail. This can result in a loss of quality when printing, if taken too far. Increasing the size will also increase the amount of material used, increasing the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Layer Height</b>
        </p>
        <p>3D printing is done by slicing the digital object horizontally into layers, then printing each layer one at a time. Layer height is the thickness of each slice. The smaller the layer height, the finer the detail of the finished print. Small layer heights take significantly longer to print because more layers are needed. Standard print jobs are printed at 0.2mm layer height and for most jobs, this is the best option. The Makerbot printers will print to as fine as 0.1mm and the Ultimaker 3 will print down to a 0.06mm layer height</p>
        <p>
          <b>Supports</b>
        </p>
        <p> It’s generally best to have Supports turned on. The printing software we use will only generate supports where needed. You have the option of regular PLA supports, which you break off once the model has finished printing, or the PVA supports, which dissolve in cold water. The PVA supports, while leaving a nicer finish on the model, are 20 cents per gram and increase printing times.</p>

      <a name="mats"></a><b>Material</b>
      <p>
        There are these materials avaialble... la la la
      </p>
      <h4>Copies</h4>
        <p>Printing multiple copies at the same time can be more efficient, however it must fit on the printing area.</p>
      <h4>Material Type</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>PLA (Polylactic Acid)
            <ul>
              <li>a form of plastic made from natural starches like cornstarch that will biodegrade in some industrial composting facilities.</li>
              <li>We charge 10 cents per gram.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>PVA Dissolving Filament
            <ul>
              <li>Also made from starch. It dissolves when you put it in water.</li>
              <li>We charge 20 cents per gram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>TPU 95a
            <ul>
              <li>a material with medium flex</li>
              <li>We charge 20 cents per gram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h4>Wait Times</h4>
        <p>This varies depending on the time of the semester. During end of term when projects are due, it may take a couple of weeks or more, since one print job can potentially take many hours. If it is a slow time, turnaround is less than a week.</p>
      <h4>Pricing</h4>
        <p>The cost is determined by the amount of material used and what kind of material used. Depending on what material is chosen, the costs vary from 10 cents to 20 cents per gram.</p>
      <h4>Color</h4>
        <p>Two-colour printing is possible with the DSC’s Ultimaker 3. Here are some things to note while creating your object:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To complete a print, projects need to be exported in either a .’obj’ file (TinkerCad and other software such as SolidWorks) or ‘.amf’ file (SolidWorks).</li>
          <li>Before exporting your complete .obj file, make sure to group objects of the same colour together and export each as a different file. These will fit together for printing to complete your two colour creation.</li>
          <li>Make sure to communicate your colour preferences when requesting a print job; to make sure that your colour choices are available at the DSC.</li>
          <li>Note: Dissolving PVA Supports are not available with two colour print jobs.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Where to collect a finished print</h4>
        <p>Once a print is finished printed, and email will be sent and can be collected from the front desk of the library.</p>
      <h4>Accepted File Types</h4>
        <p>.stl and .obj files are accepted that are less than 200MB. For larger files, please contact the DSC first. dscommons@uvic.ca</p>
      <h4>Process</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Submitted: Submit the print via the create new print in the <a href="customer-dashboard.php">customer dashboard.</a> After submission, the DSC will evaluate the cost.</li>
          <li>Pending Payment: If the print is accepted, an email regarding the cost will be sent. Else any feedback will be sent from the DSC</li>
          <li>Paid: After paying for you print in will be in the print queue and start printing when items ahead in the queue are completed.</li>
          <li>Printing: The item is currently being printed.</li>
          <li>Completed: The item has finished printing and can be collected from the front desk in the library.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Canceled: After 2 weeks of pending payment, the print will automatically be cancelled and need to be resubmitted should it need to be printed. The DSC will not cancel a print if it has not been priced or if it has been paid.</li>
          <li>Archived: The item has been printed and the .stl or .obj file has been deleted.</li>
        </ul>
